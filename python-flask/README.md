python-flask
=================

Sample web using Flask for Python.

Trying to hit one of the guides from SnapGuide.

How to run this:

1.  Install all the required modules. To know what modules you need, just go to `python-playground/python-flask/` and run `python python-server.py`. You can also look into `python-server.py` file and see the imports. I used `pip` to install all of the modules.
2.  You know you have all the modules installed when you can run `python python-server.py` successfully. It should output something like:

  ```
   * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   * Restarting with reloader
  ```
3.  Open your browser and hit `localhost:5000`
